Flight-mech documentation
=========================

This library includes a simple atmospheric model and a set of flight mechanics equations allowing to compute plane and airfoils characteristics.

You can install it using Pip with:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install flight-mech

The source code is available on Github at this `link <https://github.com/PaulCreusy/flight-mech/tree/main>`_.
